                A non-invasive stem cell delivery system
                using proprietary protein to
                repair damaged hearts
            </h2>
            <p>
                TargaCell is an early-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on repairing organ damage
                caused by disease processes to reverse disease, recover function, and restore quality of life.
                We achieve this through improved non-invasive, simple intravenous injection of our products,
                which provide targeted delivery of a second simple injection of regenerative cells to specific
                organs, thereby enhancing damaged tissue repair. The Company is developing first-in-class
                biologic therapeutics based on the characteristics of naturally occurring and chemically
                modified proprietary protein preparations and their innate ability to bind specifically with stem
                cells and block extraneous (Off-target) organ binding sites that trap them, preventing migration
                to tissues needing repair.
